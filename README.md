# Certificate Generation System
This project aims to provide a certificate generation system for students who have completed a specific course.
The program uses an Attendency-List, which has to be provided in Excel, to determine the courses for the certificate.
The certificate-template is now converted to specific certificates for each student who attended at least 1 course.
At the end, the certificates are stored in an output folder.

## Usage

1.Create an Attendency List on Excel 
2.Change the directory paths on the code
3.Start the program and generate certificates
